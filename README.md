## Overview

This project is a comprehensive Data Science analysis and machine learning study built indirectly not directly as a part of my **University Final Year Project (FYP)** on an **IoT-Based Smart Energy Meter with Home Automation**. It is also completed as a core assignment for the **Data Science** course.

The project simulates energy consumption data from a smart home environment, collected **before** and **after** the installation of an IoT-driven smart energy meter. Using this data, I performed detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and developed predictive and anomaly detection machine learning models to:

* Evaluate the impact of the smart energy meter on household power consumption.
* Predict future power usage based on appliance, room, and time features.
* Detect anomalous energy usage patterns that could indicate faults or inefficiencies.

## Project Highlights

* **Realistic simulated IoT energy data** for 30 days across multiple rooms and appliances.
* Comprehensive **data cleaning, exploration, and visualization** to uncover insights.
* Implementation of a **Random Forest regression model** to forecast power usage.
* Use of **Isolation Forest anomaly detection** to flag unusual consumption events.
* Clear, well-documented Python notebook suitable for academic submission and interview demonstration.
* Demonstrates practical application of Data Science and Machine Learning in an IoT context.

## Technologies & Tools

* Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
* Jupyter/Google Colab notebooks
* CSV data handling and preprocessing
* Machine learning algorithms for regression and anomaly detection

## How This Project Strengthens My Profile

This project combines IoT concepts with advanced Data Science techniques, reflecting my ability to:

* Work with time-series and categorical data typical in real-world IoT systems.
* Apply exploratory data analysis to identify key patterns and improvements.
* Build and evaluate machine learning models to deliver actionable insights.
* Communicate technical findings clearly with visualizations and documentation.

This experience is directly aligned with my Final Year Project theme and demonstrates my readiness for roles requiring data-driven problem-solving in smart systems and energy management.
